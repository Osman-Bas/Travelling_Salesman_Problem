# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

This project provides solutions to the classic **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using various algorithms. The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Definition
The Traveling Salesman Problem is an NP-hard optimization problem where, given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, the task is to find the shortest tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Algorithms Implemented**:
  - Brute Force (Exact solution for small graphs).
  - Dynamic Programming (DP with Bitmasking)
  - Genetic Algorithm (Approximate solution for large graphs)
- **Visualization**: Plot the optimal route and city coordinates.
- **Performance Analysis**: Compare runtime and accuracy of algorithms.

## ðŸ›  Installation
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required packages: `numpy`, `matplotlib`
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
